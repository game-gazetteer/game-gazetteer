    <h1>About Game Gazetteer</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Game Gazetteer</strong> is a growing collection of hand-crafted,
        interactive maps designed to help players explore, track, and uncover
        the hidden details of their favorite games.
    </p>

    <h2>The Idea</h2>
    <p>
        Many games are rich with secrets, collectibles, and layered environments.
        Game Gazetteer was created to serve as a modern explorer’s journal —
        a place where maps feel less like checklists and more like living atlases.
    </p>

    <h2>What Makes It Different</h2>
    <p>
        Each map is built with care, prioritizing clarity, atmosphere, and usability.
        Rather than overwhelming players with noise, Game Gazetteer focuses on
        thoughtful design, smooth interaction, and respect for the source material.
    </p>

    <h2>Independent & Fan-Made</h2>
    <p>
        Game Gazetteer is an independent, fan-created project built and maintained
        by a single creator. Every map, feature, and design decision is crafted
        by me, one person with a deep appreciation for game worlds and careful,
        hands-on craftsmanship.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project is not affiliated with or endorsed by any game developers or
        publishers. All game-related names, locations, and assets belong to their
        respective owners and are used for reference purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
        Game Gazetteer is actively evolving. New maps, features, and improvements
        are added over time as the project grows, guided by player feedback and a
        continued passion for game worlds worth exploring.
